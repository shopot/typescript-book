### Parser Functions

As mentioned `parseSourceFile` sets up the initial state and passes the work onto `parseSourceFileWorker` function.

#### `parseSourceFileWorker`

Starts by creating a `SourceFile` AST node. Then it goes into parsing source code starting from the `parseStatements` function. Once that returns, it then completes the `SourceFile` node with additional information such as its `nodeCount`, `identifierCount` and such.

#### `parseStatements`
One of the most significant `parseFoo` style functions (a concept we cover next). It switches by the the current `token` returned from the scanner. E.g. if the current token is a `SemicolonToken` it will call out to `parseEmptyStatement` to create an AST node for an empty statement.

### Node creation

The parser has a bunch of `parserFoo` functions with bodies that create `Foo` nodes. These are generally called (from other parser functions) at a time where a `Foo` node is expected. A typical sample of this process is the `parseEmptyStatement()` function which is used to parse out empty statements like `;;;;;;`. Here is the function in its entirety

```ts
function parseEmptyStatement(): Statement {
    let node = <Statement>createNode(SyntaxKind.EmptyStatement);
    parseExpected(SyntaxKind.SemicolonToken);
    return finishNode(node);
}
```

It shows three critical functions `createNode`, `parseExpected` and `finishNode`.

#### `createNode`
The parser's `createNode` function `function createNode(kind: SyntaxKind, pos?: number): Node` is responsible for creating a Node, setting up its `SyntaxKind` as passed in, and set the initial position if passed in (or use the position from the current scanner state).

#### `parseExpected`
The parser's `parseExpected` function `function parseExpected(kind: SyntaxKind, diagnosticMessage?: DiagnosticMessage): boolean` will check that the current token in the parser state matches the desired `SyntaxKind`. If not it will either report the `diagnosticMessage` sent in or create a generic one of the form `foo expected`. It internally uses the `parseErrorAtPosition` function (which uses the scanning positions) to give good error reporting.

### `finishNode`
The parser's `finishNode` function `function finishNode<T extends Node>(node: T, end?: number): T` sets up the `end` position for the node and additional useful stuff like the `parserContextFlags` it was parsed under as well as if there were any errors before parsing this node (if there were then we cannot reuse this AST node in incremental parsing).
