TypeScript Deep Dive
=======

I've been looking at the issues that turn up commonly when people start using TypeScript. This is based on the lessons from [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/tags/typescript/topusers) / [DefinitelyTyped](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/) and general engagement with the [TypeScript community](https://github.com/TypeStrong/). You can [follow for updates](https://twitter.com/basarat) and [don't forget to ‚òÖ on GitHub](https://github.com/basarat/typescript-book) üåπ
